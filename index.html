        	<p><b>Hello, my name is Javier Valdez, and I'm currently a freshman at Millersville University. I'm majoring in Construction Management, a decision I made because I knew from a young age I didn't want a job that would limit me to just sitting in an office all day. I've always enjoyed being active, working in a team, and taking on new challenges, and I felt this career would allow me to combine those passions with a stable and exciting professional future. To tell you a little more about myself, I'm Dominican and very proud of my roots. Something that defines me greatly is my love for soccer. I love playing it, watching it, and following everything related to the sport. It's more than a hobby for me; it's a true passion that influences my daily life and has taught me a lot about discipline, teamwork, and perseverance. I created this page to share some of the projects I've completed in my Communication and Information Systems class (AENG110.01). Through this space, I want to showcase my academic growth, my skills in using technological and communication tools, and also offer a glimpse into my work style. I hope those who visit this page can learn a little more about me, not only as a student, but also as a person. <br><br>
